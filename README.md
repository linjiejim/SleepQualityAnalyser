# Sleep Quality Analyser
COMP5047 Pervasive Computing Group Project

## Desciption
In this project, we developed SleepAnalyser, a non-intrusive device which gathers sleep environment data including temperature, humidity, noise, brightness and air quality. A self-assessed sleep score is also implemented to analyse the correlation between usersâ€™ quality of sleep and the collected environmental data. This information will then offer users recommendations on how to change their sleep environment to improve overall sleep quality. We also aim to avoid complicated hardware setup and intrusive wearable devices that can cause uncomfortable sleeping experience, which is the strong point of SleepAnalyser. However, this approach also leads to a few limitations, notably the cost and accuracy factors.
